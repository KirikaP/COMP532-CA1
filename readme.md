# COMP532-CA1 Multi-Armed Bandit Problem
## UCB - Upper Confidence Bound
The UCB (Upper Confidence Bound) algorithm is a method that balances **exploration** and **exploitation** in the multi-armed bandit problem. The formula is as follows
$$A_t \approx \underset{a}{\text{argmax}}
\Bigg[ Q_t(a) + c\sqrt{\frac{\ln{t}}{N_t(a)}} \Bigg]$$
where
- $洧냢_洧노$ is the action selected in time step $洧노$
- $洧녟_洧노(洧녩)$ is the estimated value at action $洧녩$
- $洧녜_洧노(洧녩)$ is the number of times action $洧녩$ is selected up to time step $洧노$
- $c$ is the exploration parameter, which determines the trade-off between exploration and exploitation

Core idea: Estimate an upper confidence bound for each action and select the action with the highest upper bound at each step. 
The higher the upper bound, the greater the potential of the action:
- its estimated value is high (exploit)
- relatively high uncertainty (explore)
